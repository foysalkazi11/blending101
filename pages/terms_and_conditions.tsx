        <h3>1. OUR SERVICES</h3>
        <p>
          The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
          entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or
          which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those
          persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely
          responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and
          Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your
          interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a
          way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

        <Heading3 heading="20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION" />
        <Heading3 heading="Informal Negotiations" />
        <ParagraphWithBreak text='To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.' />
        <Heading3 heading="Binding Arbitration" />
        <p>
          If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those
          Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU
          UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The
          arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
          Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the AAAâ€™s Supplementary Procedures for
          Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are available at the 
          <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">
            American Arbitration Association (AAA) website
          </a>
          . Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules
          and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to
          be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person,
          through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but
          need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow
          applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise
          required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in __________. Except
          as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings
          pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ParagraphWithBreak text="If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in theÂ state and federal courtsÂ located in United States Of America, Florida, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms." />
        <ParagraphWithBreak text="If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court." />
        <Heading3 heading="Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration" />
        <ParagraphWithBreak text="The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court." />
