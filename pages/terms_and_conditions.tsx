      <h3>1. OUR SERVICES</h3>
      <p>
        The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
        entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or
        which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those

      <p>
        The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and

        violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
